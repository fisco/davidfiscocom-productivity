I moved all of my projects to the cloud, using Web applications such as Springpad and Google Docs to create the majority of my project assets. &nbsp; But as my list of requisite Web applications grew, I found myself becoming increasingly burdened by searching for—and sometimes just remembering—my resources for any given project. So, I decided to use Google Chrome bookmarks to organize my cloud assets by project, with each project having a folder providing links to the part of each Web application that applies to a given project. &nbsp;For example, if my project has a bibliography handled by Zotero, clicking on the Zotero icon in the project's folder will take me <i>directly</i> to the bibliography folder associated with that project, not the "top" of the Zotero Web application.<br /><br />You'll find that each project is different, using different cloud resources. &nbsp;Here is a list of instructions on how to create project-specific bookmarks for some of the Web applications I use most frequently. <br /><br /><ol><li>In Chrome's bookmark manager, create a bookmark folder with your project's name.</li><li><a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/">Remember the Milk</a>: &nbsp;Create a task list with your project's name in Remember the Milk. &nbsp;Visit that list in Remember the Milk and click on "Print" on the right-hand side. &nbsp;Copy to the clipboard the URL that Chrome sends you to. &nbsp;Back in the bookmarks manager, select your project's folder and tell the bookmark manager to add a new page. &nbsp;Set the title of the new page to "Tasks" and paste the URL you just copied into the address field. &nbsp;Then, in the URL, replace "print" with "home". &nbsp;(This hack is necessary to go directly to a given task list.)</li><li><a href="http://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a>: &nbsp;In your Zotero library, create a new collection with your project's name. &nbsp;Open the new collection by clicking it, and use the star on the address bar to add the address as a bookmark to your project's folder, altering the title if you want.</li><li><a href="http://docs.google.com/">Google Docs</a>: &nbsp;In Google Docs, create a new collection with your project's name. &nbsp;Open the new collection by clicking it, and use the star on the address bar to add the address as a bookmark to your project's folder, altering the title if you want.</li><li><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a>: &nbsp;In Dropbox, navigate to the directory you will keep your project's files in, creating it if necessary. &nbsp;Use the star on the address bar to add the address as a bookmark to your project's folder, altering the title if you want.</li><li><a href="http://blogger.google.com/">Blogger</a>: &nbsp;In Blogger, create a blog for your project and visit the overview page of that blog. &nbsp;Use the star on the address bar to add the overview page's address as a bookmark to your project's folder, altering the title if you want.</li><li><a href="http://evernote.com/">Evernote</a>: &nbsp;In Evernote, create a notebook for your project and visit the notebook. &nbsp;Use the star on the address bar to add the address as a bookmark to your project's folder, altering the title if you want.</li><li>Finally, back in the Chrome bookmark manager, sort (using "Reorder by Title") all of your newly-created project bookmarks and, if necessary, sort the folder containing all of your projects so they will also be in alphabetical order.</li></ol><br />You&nbsp;<i>don't</i>&nbsp;need to create the full set of bookmarks and resources for each new project you create. &nbsp;When I start a new project, I sometimes create&nbsp;only&nbsp;a bookmark folder for that project, then the first time I look for a cloud resource that isn't in the folder, I create it and bookmark it. &nbsp;You may want to create your own checklist with instructions on how to add the resources you use. &nbsp;Then, when creating a new project, you could use your checklist to create the resources you know you'll need for the given project. &nbsp;For example, almost all projects need task management, so you might want to include a Remember the Milk bookmark to your project's task list every time you create a new project.<br /><br />There's another benefit to accessing your assets through bookmark folders rather than searching through Web applications: &nbsp;It helps you concentrate. &nbsp;When you open a project's bookmarks folder, you've made a decision to work on <i>that</i> project, and you know your thoughts should be focused on that project, not wandering into another. &nbsp;For example, when I access my Remember the Milk tasks through a project's bookmark folder, my thoughts focus on the tasks of that project, to the exclusion of all of my other responsibilities. &nbsp;I find it superior to opening up a Web app at some "home page" and being barraged by an array of things I'll eventually need to get around to. &nbsp;It's a good habit to get into.<br /><br />I use Google Chrome as my standard browser, but it's easy to adapt this technique to any browser. &nbsp;If you'd like access to your bookmarks from anywhere or the ability to&nbsp;synchronize&nbsp;your bookmarks between different browsers, check out <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ajpgkpeckebdhofmmjfgcjjiiejpodla">Xmarks</a>.
