In the *Seven Habits of Highly Successful People*, author Stephen Covey wrote as his 6th habit:

Here's a way to synergize foreign language learning with your online studies.

MOOCs are a great way to enhance your skill-set. Institutions offer thousands of offerings, many free to audit. What is less-known about the MOOCs is that many offered in English also offer transcripts of the videos in other languages.

Here's where the synergy comes in: If a course you're intereted in offers transcripts in a language you are trying to learn, those 
foreign language transcripts become a lesson for your foreign language. Copying the transcripts, or even just reading them (silently or aloud) becomes a synergistic exercise between the MOOC and the foreign language you are trying to master.

#### Case Study

Having no experience with the programming language Scala, I signed up for Coursera's [Functional Programming Principles in Scala|https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1/home/welcome] course. Viewing the first lecture, I learned that the transcripts were available in several languages, including French.

I make it a habit to dedicate 20 minutes each day to learning French, using a variety of online sources. But, for now, the online sources are on hold as I spend those daily 20-minute sessions copying the Scala lectures in French. Not only am I strengthening my French, but also I'm reviewing my auto-didactic efforts in French.

Ç'est très utile.
