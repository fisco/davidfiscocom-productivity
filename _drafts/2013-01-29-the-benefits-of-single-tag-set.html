<i>This article defines a problem encountered when regularly using multiple web applications that offer tagging functionality. &nbsp;It proposes a solution, in the form of a software extension, for those who use Google Chrome.</i><br /><br /><a name='more'></a><br /><b>The Problem</b><br /><br />In the course of an average week, I use several applications that have some form of "tagging" functionality. (Although those little pieces of text might not always be called tags; some developers like to call them "labels".) Applications with tagging include Zotero, Evernote, Springpad, Blogger, Gmail, Pocket, Catch, Remember the Milk and TiddlyWiki.<br /><br />The problem is that each of these apps maintains its own set of tags, which can make organization via tagging sub-optimal for the user. &nbsp;Wouldn't it be great if you needed to maintain only one authoritative set of tags and could choose from that set for any web application? &nbsp;Wouldn't it also be great to be able to copy-and-paste them easily, and eliminate typographical errors that make searching for&nbsp;misspelled&nbsp;tags difficult? &nbsp;Wouldn't it be helpful if that tag set synchronized across all of the computers you use?<br /><br /><b>A Solution</b><br /><br />A few months ago, I released a Google Chrome extension called <span style="color: blue;">Text</span>Stash that allows you to store pieces of text you use frequently. &nbsp;I've augmented this extension to include a "tag base" where you can keep the definitive list of tags for all of your applications. &nbsp;The tag set will synchronize with any computer with which you sign in to Google through Google Chrome. &nbsp;(And <span style="background-color: white;"><span style="color: blue;">Text</span></span>Stash is free of charge!)<br /><br />If you are using Google Chrome and you'd like to give <span style="color: blue;">Text</span>Stash a try, <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/textstash/pkcgcekemfdlkbeceaendmllombbfdib?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon" target="_blank">install the extension from the Chrome Web Store</a>. &nbsp;Once installed, you'll see a new icon in your Google Chrome bar. &nbsp;When you click on it, a drop-down will appear. &nbsp;In this drop-down you'll be able to quick-add tags to your set. &nbsp;You can click on "Edit my tags..." and a new tab will appear where you can modify all of your <span style="color: blue;">Text</span>Stash data.<br /><br />When you want to include a tag in one of your applications, click on the <span style="color: blue;">Text</span>Stash icon in the Chrome bar and in the resulting drop-down, click on the tag you want to include. &nbsp;This will close the drop-down and copy that tag to your computer's clipboard. &nbsp;Now, paste the tag wherever you want.<br /><br />Enjoy using <span style="color: blue;">Text</span>Stash and remember you can send me <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/textstash/pkcgcekemfdlkbeceaendmllombbfdib/details?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon">feedback</a>.<br /><br />
