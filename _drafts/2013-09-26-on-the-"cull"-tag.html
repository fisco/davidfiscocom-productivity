<br />I organize my projects using Springpad notebooks. &nbsp;Each project has a notebook. &nbsp;It's the digital equivalent of Twyla Tharp's cardboard boxes. (See chapter 5 of <i>The Creative Habit</i> if you want to learn more about this.)<br /><br />Recently, I was grazing through all of my unprocessed items in my Springpad folders. Most of them were tagged "to-do" some were tagged "to be read" and some videos were tagged "to be watched". But something was wrong. Too many of these items seemed to be mistagged. &nbsp;Sure, a video on x in project y should be tagged "to be watched" so that when I'm in an environment where I can watch a video, I can put that time to good use.<br /><br />But too many items really weren't things that needed to be "done", but rather things that needed to be perused for other things to read, watch and do. That's when I came up with a tag for these items that will engender more tangible items: "cull".<br /><br />It's sort of akin to Tharp's concept of "scratching", but it's a bit later in the process. You know your project, you know what track you're on...you simply want to use the item at hand to find other, more specific items. Tharp's scratching is more about finding "an idea", latching on to it and allowing it to carry you to more ideas. &nbsp;In culling, the ideas (or articles, books or videos) are already there, you just have to sift through the material to find them. It's like panning for gold: you need to pick through the mud to find those resources that are gold for your project.<br /><br />In scratching, you know you need to find some gold, but you're not sure where it is. In culling, you know you've got some gold, you just need to separate it from the non-gold.<br /><br /><br />Bibliography<br />Tharpe, Twyla. <i>The Creative Habit</i>.
