This article discusses a technique for&nbsp;maximizing&nbsp;performance in any task, by ensuring that you are able to&nbsp;perform&nbsp;all sub-tasks before you begin.<br /><br />The technique I am going to discuss should strike you as obvious, but in my dealings with learners of all ages, I am surprised at how often these simple instructions are overlooked. &nbsp;I call the technique "Stop, Drop and Learn", or stated another way, don't forge ahead with anything until you know what you're doing.<br /><br />Any activity--grand or petit--requires prior knowledge. &nbsp;Remember when you didn't know how to tie your shoelaces? &nbsp;Well, I once knew a man in his sixties who hadn't learned that if he double-knotted his shoelaces they had a lower probability of becoming untied throughout the day. &nbsp;He's someone who would have benefitted from Stop, Drop and Learn.<br /><br /><br />
